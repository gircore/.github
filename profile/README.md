## Welcome to Gir.Core

This organization wraps different repositories which are used to create the [Gir.Core](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core) project.

We aim to provide C# bindings for GObject based libraries including a C# friendly API surface.

* The code can be found in the [gir.core](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core) repository.
* To generate the Code we reley on XML based API descriptions. Those files can be found in the [gir-files](https://github.com/gircore/gir-files) repository.

If you want to write C# code which integrates well into the GObject stack, feel free to visist our [website](https://gircore.github.io/)
